- printed uses gamut
- future: compressed texture respresented as is in Image.
  Functions just for them:
     blockWidth / blockHeight / blockScanline
  Function they can't use: 
     scanline

- QOIX should be more like QOI2 from the QOI bikeshed github. Because it improves a lot over QOI, use FIFO, etc.
