Generally I'd like to:
- support 10-bit => type punning probably, because QOI opcodes not really designed for more bits
- experiment with lossy for increasing compression?
  * interesting, since the difference to reconstructed need to be considered
  * quite easy to do, since QOI have simple encoding you don't need to do RDO
