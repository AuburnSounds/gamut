Generally I'd like to:
- improves compression efficiency => follow "QOIR" repo, already not bad
- support 10-bit => type punning
- support YUV?
- experiment with lossy for increasing compression
- increase complexity and slow down encoding

- technically, you could have 4 parallel slices encoding/decoding at once with SIMD.
