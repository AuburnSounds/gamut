Generally I'd like to:
- support 10-bit => type punning probably, because QOI opcodes not really designed for more bits
- support L and LA better => QOI not adapted for this use case, must break down tokens to smaller values
   * another codec for uint8 images?
   * technically, you could have 4 parallel slices encoding/decoding at once with SIMD.
- experiment with lossy for increasing compression?
